During pregnancy, everyone asks, "What are you eating?" You take vitamins, you track protein.
Then the baby is born, and suddenly, you are eating a stale granola bar at 3 PM and calling it lunch.

Postpartum depletion is real. Your body has gone through a massive event (birth) and is now demanding huge energy for recovery and potentially lactation.

## The Nutrient Gap
Your nutrient stores (especially Iron, Zinc, B12, and Folate) are depleted by pregnancy and blood loss during birth. If you don't replenish them, you risk fatigue, brain fog, and mood disorders.

## Key Nutrients for Recovery
1.  **Iron:** Essential for energy.
    *   *Sources:* Red meat, lentils, spinach (pair with Vitamin C), dark chocolate.
2.  **Protein:** The building block for tissue repair.
    *   *Goal:* Aim for 20-30g at every meal.
    *   *Sources:* Eggs, greek yogurt, chicken, tofu, protein powder.
3.  **Omega-3 Fats (DHA):** Critical for fighting "mommy brain" and reducing inflammation.
    *   *Sources:* Salmon, walnuts, chia seeds, fish oil supplement.
4.  **Hydration:** Especially if breastfeeding.
    *   *Goal:* 3 Liters a day. Keep water EVERYWHERE.

## The "One-Handed" Diet
Newborns don't respect meal times. You need food you can eat with one hand while holding a baby.

### Snack Ideas
*   **The Adult Lunchable:** Cheese stick, almonds, apple slices.
*   **Hard Boiled Eggs:** Boil 6 at start of the week.
*   **Smoothies:** Pre-pack bags in the freezer (spinach, berries, protein powder). Just dump and blend.
*   **Energy Balls:** Oats, peanut butter, honey, chocolate chips mixed together. No bake.

## Meal Prep for Tired Parents
Do not try to cook a 3-course meal.
1.  **Tray Bakes:** Sausage, peppers, potatoes, olive oil. Throw on one sheet pan. Bake. Done.
2.  **Slow Cooker:** Dump ingredients in the morning. Eat hot food at night.
3.  **Accept the Lasagna:** If friends ask "What can I do?", say "Bring food."

## Supplements
Continue taking your prenatal vitamin! It is designed to cover the high needs of pregnancy *and* lactation. Most experts recommend taking it for at least 6 months postpartum.

## Relationship with Body Image
You might feel pressure to "bounce back." Please, delete that phrase from your vocabulary. Your body grew a human. It nurtured a human. It is healing. Treat it with kindness, not restriction. Focus on how you *feel* (energy), not how you look.

## Conclusion
Food is medicine. By prioritizing your nutrition, you are investing in your ability to parent with patience and presence. Eat the sandwich. You deserve it.
