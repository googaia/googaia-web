A baby is a grenade thrown into a marriage. A cute grenade, but a grenade.
Research shows that relationship satisfaction plummets after the first child. But it rebounds—if you do the work.

## The Sources of Conflict
1.  **The Scoreboard:** "I changed 5 diapers, you only changed 2." "I was up at 3 AM, you slept till 7."
    *   *Truth:* You are both working 100%. Comparing suffering leads to resentment.
2.  **The Gatekeeping:** (Usually Mom) criticizing how (Dad) does things. "That's the wrong onesie!" "You aren't holding him right!"
    *   *Result:* The partner stops trying because they feel incompetent.
3.  **Touched Out:** After holding a baby for 12 hours, the last thing you want is another human touching you. This kills intimacy.

## Survival Strategies

### 1. The Weekly Logistics Meeting
Do not discuss the schedule at 10 PM.
Sit down Sunday night for 15 mins.
*   Who is doing Drop off/Pick up?
*   Who is cooking which night?
*   Who gets "off duty" time?

### 2. Explicit division of Labor (Fair Play)
Instead of "helping," own a task entirely.
*   **Person A:** Owns Laundry (Wash, dry, fold, put away).
*   **Person B:** Owns Dishes (Load, unload, scrub pots).
When you own the task, you don't have to ask/nag.

### 3. The 10-Minute Connection
You might not have time for Date Night. But you have 10 minutes.
Put phones away. Sit on the couch. Ask: "How was your day, really?"
Not about the baby. About *them*.

### 4. Sleep Equity
Sleep deprivation makes us mean.
If one parent is doing all night wakes, they will resent the sleeping parent.
*   **Shift Work:** Parent A does 8PM-2AM. Parent B does 2AM-8AM. Everyone gets a chunk of guaranteed sleep.

## Intimacy (It's Not Just Sex)
Intimacy is a text saying "You're a great dad."
Intimacy is bringing her coffee in bed.
Intimacy is holding hands.
Sex will come back when the bodies heal and the sleep returns. Focus on *connection* first.

## Conclusion
You are on the same team. The baby is the chaos. Do not fight each other; fight the chaos together.
