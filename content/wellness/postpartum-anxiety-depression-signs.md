"I should be happy. Why am I not happy?"
Postpartum Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMADs) are the #1 complication of childbirth. They affect 1 in 5 parents. Yet, we rarely talk about them honestly.

## The Baby Blues (Normal)
*   **What it is:** A hormonal crash (estrogen/progesterone drop) combined with sleep deprivation.
*   **Timing:** Starts days 3-4, peaks day 5, resolves by day 14.
*   **Symptoms:** Weepiness, irritability, mood swings.
*   **Treatment:** Sleep, good food, time.

## Postpartum Depression (PPD)
If the "blues" last longer than 2 weeks, it might be PPD.
*   **The Vibe:** A heavy fog. Numbness.
*   **Signs:**
    *   Feeling detached from the baby ("I'm just babysitting").
    *   Inability to sleep even when baby sleeps.
    *   Loss of appetite.
    *   Thoughts of harming yourself or running away.
    *   *Note:* It is not always "sadness." It often manifests as **Rage**.

## Postpartum Anxiety (PPA)
This is actually more common than PPD but less discussed.
*   **The Vibe:** buzzing, vibrating skin, inability to sit still.
*   **Signs:**
    *   **Intrusive Thoughts:** "What if I drop the baby down the stairs?" "What if the car crashes?" These are scary, flash-images.
    *   **Checking:** Checking the baby's breathing 50 times a night.
    *   **Dread:** A constant feeling that something bad is about to happen.

## The "Scary Thoughts"
Intrusive thoughts (dropping the baby, stabbing, etc.) are a hallmark of PPA/OCD.
**Crucial Distinction:** Parents with PPA are horrified by these thoughts and do everything to prevent them. They are not psychotic. They are terrified.

## How to Get Help
1.  **Tell ONE Person:** Your partner, your mom, your friend. Just say "I am not okay."
2.  **Call the OB/Midwife:** You don't need a psychiatrist. Your OB can prescribe safe medication (Zoloft is the gold standard for breastfeeding) immediately.
3.  **Therapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is incredibly effective for rewiring anxious brains.

## You Are Not Broken
You are not a bad parent. You have a medical condition.
With treatment, you will feel like yourself again. Do not wait. You deserve to enjoy your life.
