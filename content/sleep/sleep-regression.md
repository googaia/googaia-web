Sleep regression is a term that strikes fear into the hearts of tired parents everywhere. Just when you think you've cracked the code, everything changes.

## What is it?
A sleep regression is a period of time when a baby who has been sleeping well suddenly starts waking at night or skipping naps.

### Common Ages
- **4 Months:** The big one. Permanent change in sleep cycles.
- **8-10 Months:** Linked to crawling and standing.
- **18 Months:** Separation anxiety and teething.

## How to Survive
1. **Stick to a Routine:** Bedtime routines signal to the brain that sleep is coming.
2. **Practice Skills:** Give baby plenty of floor time to practice new skills during the day so they don't practice at 3 AM.
3. **Patience:** This too shall pass.

Keep the room dark, cool, and use white noise. You'll get through this!
