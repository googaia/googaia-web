You have the routine. You have the Swaddle. You have the right feeding schedule. But if your baby's room is too bright, too hot, or too quiet, they might still struggle to settle.

Sleep hygiene isn't just for adults. The environment where your baby sleeps sets the stage for the release of melatonin (the sleep hormone) and prevents environmental stimulation that causes night wakings.

We are going to audit your nursery, element by element, to create a sleep sanctuary.

## 1. Darkness: The darker, the better.

Light is the enemy of sleep. It signals the brain to wake up.

*   **The Test:** Go into your baby's room at noon and close the blinds/curtains. hold your hand in front of your face. If you can see your hand clearly, it's too bright.
*   **The Fix:**
    *   **Blackout Curtains:** Invest in high-quality ones.
    *   **Window Film:** For tricky windows, apply opaque black window film directly to the glass.
    *   **Travel Blinds:** Use suction-cup blackout shades (like Sleepout) for 100% darkness.
*   **Night Lights:** If you need a light for feeding, use **RED** light. Red light does not interfere with melatonin production. Blue or white light (even dim) does.

## 2. White Noise: The Sound of the Womb

The womb is loud—about as loud as a vacuum cleaner (80-90 decibels). A silent room can feel scary to a newborn.

*   **Why it works:**
    1.  **Comfort:** Mimics the womb.
    2.  **Masking:** Covers up the sound of the dog barking, the floor creaking, or you watching Netflix in the next room.
*   **The Rules:**
    *   **Continuous:** Don't use a timer. It should run all night. If it turns off, the sudden silence can wake the baby.
    *   **Sound:** Use "Pink Noise" (deeper, like heavy rain) or "Brown Noise" (rumble). Avoid high-pitched sounds like birds or ocean waves that crash.
    *   **Volume:** Around 50-60 decibels (conversation level) at the crib.

## 3. Temperature: Cool and Comfortable

Overheating is a SIDS risk. Babies sleep better in cooler rooms.

*   **The Sweet Spot:** 68°F to 72°F (20°C - 22°C).
*   **How to Dress:**
    *   **Summer (75°F+):** Diaper + Light Sleep Sack (0.5 TOG).
    *   **Normal (70°F):** Onesie + Cotton Sleep Sack (1.0 TOG).
    *   **Winter (65°F):** Footie Pajamas + Fleece/Wool Sleep Sack (2.5 TOG).
*   **Check the Baby, Not the Hands:** A baby's hands and feet are usually cool (poor circulation). Check their chest or back of the neck. If it's sweaty or hot, they are overdressed.

## 4. Humidity: The Goldilocks Zone

*   **Dry Air:** Causes congestion, dry skin, and increased susceptibility to colds.
*   **Ideal Level:** 40-60% humidity.
*   **Humidifier:** Use a cool-mist humidifier.
    *   *Warning:* You MUST clean it daily or weekly. Mold grows quickly in humidifiers and pumping mold spores into the air is dangerous.

## 5. Safety: A Boring Crib is a Safe Crib

We all love Pinterest nurseries with pillows and stuffed animals. But for sleep, boring is best.

*   **The Sleep Surface:** Firm mattress. Tight fitted sheet. That's it.
*   **No Bumpers:** They pose a suffocation and strangulation risk.
*   **No Positioners:** Wedges or rolled towels are unsafe.
*   **Wait for the Pillow:** No pillows until age 2 (when they move to a toddler bed).
*   **Cord Safety:** Ensure monitor cords and blind cords are at least 3 feet away from the crib.

## 6. The "Sleep Smell"

Olfactory association is powerful.

*   **Lotion:** Use a calming lavender lotion as part of the bedtime routine every night. The smell will trigger the "it's time to sleep" association in the brain.
*   **Your Scent:** If baby is struggling to settle, sleep with their crib sheet for a night so it smells like you, then put it on their mattress.

## Summary Checklist
1.  [ ] Pitch Black (Red light only).
2.  [ ] Continuous White Noise.
3.  [ ] Temp 68-72°F.
4.  [ ] Cool-mist humidifier (if air is dry).
5.  [ ] Empty Crib (Sheet + Mattress + Sleep Sack).

Create this environment, and you remove 50% of the reasons babies wake up at night. The rest is hunger and comfort!
