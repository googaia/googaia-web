Around 6 months, babies are ready for solid foods. But how you introduce them is up to you.

## Baby Led Weaning (BLW)
The baby feeds themselves manageable pieces of food right from the start.
*   **Pros:** Encourages independence, fine motor skills, and family meals.
*   **Cons:** Messy! Gagging can be scary initially.

## Purees (Traditional)
Spoon-feeding smooth purees, gradually increasing texture.
*   **Pros:** Less mess, easy to track intake.
*   **Cons:** Can be expensive if buying jars, harder transition to table foods later.

## The Verdict?
Do what works for your family! Many parents do a mix of both. The most important thing is offering a variety of flavors and nutrients, especially iron-rich foods.
