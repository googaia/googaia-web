Fed is best. Period.
Whether you chose formula from day one or switched after breastfeeding, your baby can thrive on formula. It is a modern miracle of science.

But the aisle at the grocery store is confusing. Hydrolyzed? Soy? A2? And what about the water temperature?

## Choosing a Formula
All infant formulas sold in the US (and most Western countries) are strictly regulated by the FDA. They **all** meet the nutritional requirements for growth.

### The Types
1.  **Cow's Milk Based (Standard):** Start here. (Enfamil NeuroPro, Similac 360, Costco Kirkland ProCare). Most babies do fine on this.
2.  **Gentle/Sensitive:** Partially hydrolyzed proteins (broken down slightly). Good for gassy babies.
3.  **Soy Based:** For vegan families or rare medical conditions (Galactosemia).
4.  **Hypoallergenic:** For Cow's Milk Protein Allergy (CMPA). These smell bad and are expensive (Nutramigen, Alimentum). Only use if a doctor tells you to.

### Forms
*   **Powder:** Cheapest. Needs mixing.
*   **Concentrate:** Liquid you mix with water.
*   **Ready-to-Feed (RTF):** Liquid gold. Most expensive, but sterile. *Doctors recommend RTF for the first 2-3 months if you can afford it, or for preemies.*

## Preparation Safety
1.  **Water:** Tap water is usually fine if your city has safe water. If you have well water, boil it or use nursery water.
2.  **Mixing order:** Water FIRST, then powder. 
    *   *Correct:* 2oz water + 1 scoop = 2.2oz of formula.
    *   *Incorrect:* 1 scoop + water added to reach 2oz line. (This effectively "concentrates" the formula, which is dangerous for kidneys).
3.  **Temperature:** Room temperature or warm is fine. Cold is also fine! If you start with cold milk, you never have to worry about warming it up at 3AM.

## Paced Bottle Feeding
This is crucial, especially if you are also breastfeeding (combo feeding).
Paced feeding mimics the breast. It forces the baby to work for the milk rather than it pouring down their throat.
1.  **Sit Upright:** Hold baby almost vertical, not lying back.
2.  **Horizontal Bottle:** Hold bottle parallel to floor. Milk should fill the nipple only halfway.
3.  **Breaks:** Every 20-30 seconds, tip the bottle down to stop flow (keep nipple in mouth). Let baby breathe.

## How Much?
*   **Newborn:** 1.5 - 3 oz every 2-3 hours.
*   **6 Months:** 6 - 8 oz every 4-5 hours.
*   **Max:** Most babies max out at 32oz a day. If they want more than that, they might be ready for solids!

## Sterilization
Sterilize bottles and nipples before the first use (boil for 5 mins).
After that, hot soapy water or the dishwasher is fine for healthy, full-term babies. If baby is premature or immunocompromised, sterilize daily.

## Conclusion
Formula feeding allows partners to bond equally during feeds. It allows you to track exactly how much baby is eating. It is a valid, healthy, wonderful way to nourish your child.
