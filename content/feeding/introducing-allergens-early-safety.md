For decades, pediatricians said: "Avoid peanuts until age 3."
The result? Peanut allergies tripled.

The landmark **LEAP Study (Learning Early About Peanut Allergy)** changed everything. It proved that introducing allergens *early* (between 4-11 months) reduces the risk of developing an allergy by up to 80%.

## The Big 9 Allergens
These account for 90% of food allergies:
1.  Peanut
2.  Tree Nuts (Almond, Cashew, Walnut)
3.  Egg
4.  Cow's Milk (Dairy)
5.  Wheat
6.  Soy
7.  Fish
8.  Shellfish
9.  Sesame

## When to Start
As soon as baby starts solids (around 6 months).
*   *Note:* If your baby has severe eczema or an existing egg allergy, consult an allergist first. They are "High Risk."

## How to Introduce Safely

### 1. One at a Time
Introduce one new allergen at a time. Wait 2-3 days before the next one so you can pinpoint a reaction.
*   *Day 1:* Peanut butter mixed with oatmeal.
*   *Day 2:* Same thing.
*   *Day 3:* Same thing. Success! Now try Egg.

### 2. Time of Day
Morning is best. Never introduce a completely new allergen at dinner. You want to be awake to watch for a reaction for at least 2 hours.

### 3. Preparation (Choking Safety)
*   **Peanut/Nut Butters:** NEVER give a spoonful of nut butter (choking hazard). Thin it out with water, breastmilk, or mix into yogurt/oatmeal.
*   **Eggs:** Scrambled well or hard-boiled and mashed.
*   **Dairy:** Greek yogurt or shredded cheese. (No liquid cow's milk to drink until age 1).

## What a Reaction Looks Like
Most reactions happen within minutes or up to 2 hours.

### Mild Reaction
*   Hives (red welts) around the mouth or face.
*   Red, itchy eyes.
*   Mild tummy ache/vomiting.
*   *Action:* Stop the food. Call pediatrician. Give Benadryl/Zyrtec *if instructed by doctor*.

### Severe Reaction (Anaphylaxis) - CALL 911
*   Difficulty breathing (wheezing).
*   Swelling of tongue or throat.
*   Pale/Blue skin.
*   Limpness/Unconsciousness.
*   Profuse vomiting (whole body heaving).

## Consistency is Key
This is the part parents miss. Introducing it once isn't enough. You have to keep it in the diet.
**"Early and Often."**
Ideally, feed allergens 2-3 times a week for the first few years of life to train the immune system that these proteins are safe.

## Conclusion
Food is fun, but it can be scary. By following the science of Early Introduction, you are actively training your baby's immune system and potentially saving them from a life of carrying an EpiPen.
