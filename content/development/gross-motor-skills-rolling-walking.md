Watching your baby learn to move is one of the most exciting parts of the first year. Every wiggle, kick, and push-up is a building block for future athleticism and coordination.

But it can also be a source of anxiety. "Why isn't he crawling yet?" "Is she walking too late?"

Let’s break down the major milestones, the wide range of "normal," and how you can help your baby get moving.

## The Foundation: Tummy Time
It all starts here.
*   **When to Start:** Day 1 (if medically cleared).
*   **The Goal:** Strengthen the neck, shoulders, and core.
*   **How Much:** Aim for 3-5 sessions a day, starting with 1-2 minutes and building up to 60 minutes total by 3 months.
*   **Hate it?** Try doing it on your chest, over a yoga ball, or propped slightly on a breastfeeding pillow.

## Milestone 1: Rolling (3-6 Months)
*   **Front to Back:** Usually happens first (around 3-4 months) because their big head tips them over.
*   **Back to Front:** Requires more core strength (around 5-6 months).
*   **How to Help:** Place a toy just out of reach to the side. Encourage them to reach across their body.

## Milestone 2: Sitting (6-9 Months)
*   **Tripod Sit:** Baby sits but leans forward on hands (6 months).
*   **Independent Sit:** Hands are free to play with toys (7-8 months).
*   **How to Help:** Sit them between your legs for support. Place toys at shoulder height to encourage upright posture.

## Milestone 3: Crawling (7-10 Months)
Crawling is crucial for brain development (cross-lateral movement connects the left and right hemispheres).
*   **Styles:** Classic hands-and-knees, army crawl, bear crawl, or the "bum scoot." All are valid!
*   **Note:** Some babies skip crawling and go straight to walking. This is usually okay, but mention it to your pediatrician.
*   **How to Help:** Get down on the floor! Use tunnels, cushions, and obstacles to make it fun.

## Milestone 4: Pulling to Stand & Cruising (9-12 Months)
*   **Pulling Up:** Using the couch or crib rails to hoist themselves up.
*   **Cruising:** Walking sideways while holding onto furniture. This builds hip strength and balance.
*   **How to Help:** Place toys on the sofa cushions to encourage standing. Move furniture slightly apart to encourage "bridging" the gap.

## Milestone 5: Walking (10-18 months)
The range here is HUGE. A baby walking at 10 months is normal. A baby walking at 17 months is also normal.
1.  **First Steps:** Wide stance, arms up high ("high guard"), wobbly.
2.  **Toddling:** The "Frankenstein walk." Knees don't bend much.
3.  **Running:** Typically develops about 6 months after walking begins.

**SHOES:** Keep them barefoot as much as possible! Babies grip with their toes and need sensory feedback from the floor to learn balance. Only use shoes for outdoor protection.

## Red Flags (When to Evaluation)
See a pediatric physical therapist if your baby:
*   Has a strong preference for looking only one way (Torticollis).
*   Is not rolling by 7 months.
*   Is not sitting by 10 months.
*   IsNot walking by 18 months.
*   Shows significant asymmetry (uses only one hand/leg).

## Conclusion
Movement is joy. Put your phone down, get on the carpet, and be your baby's jungle gym. You are their best toy.
