You walked out of the hospital doors, strapped your tiny human into the car seat (after checking the straps three times), and drove home at 20 mph. Now you are standing in your living room, holding your baby, and asking the question every new parent asks: *"Now what?"*

The first 24 hours at home are a unique mix of euphoria, exhaustion, and mild panic. In the hospital, you had a buzz button that summoned nurses. At home, you have... Google.

This guide is your virtual nurse. We will cover exactly what to expect and what to do in that first crucial day to keep your baby safe and your sanity intact.

## The Environment: Creating Your Nest

Before you do anything else, abandon the idea of "getting things done." Your only job for the next few weeks is to feed the baby, feed yourself, and sleep.

### Set Up Stations
You don't want to be running up and down stairs. Create a "nest" in the main living area with:
*   **Diaper Station:** Diapers, wipes, cream, and a change of clothes (for baby and you—accidents happen).
*   **Feeding Station:** Water bottle (huge), snacks (one-handed), nursing pillow, and burp cloths.
*   **Rest Station:** A safe place to put the baby down (bassinet, pack-n-play) so you can go to the bathroom.

## Feeding: The Main Event

Newborns have tiny stomachs (the size of a marble on day one, a ping-pong ball by day three). This means they need to eat *constantly*.

### Breastfeeding
*   **Frequency:** Aim for 8-12 feeds in 24 hours. That's essentially every 2-3 hours.
*   **The Latch:** It shouldn't hurt! A tug is normal; pinching pain is not. If it hurts, break the seal with your pinky finger and try again.
*   **Cluster Feeding:** If your baby wants to eat every hour for a stretch, don't panic. This is normal and helps boost your milk supply.

### Formula Feeding
*   **Volume:** Most newborns only take 15-30ml (0.5 - 1 oz) per feed in the first days. Do not force them to finish a bottle.
*   **Pace:** Hold the bottle horizontally to let the baby control the flow.

### Burping
Newborns have immature digestive systems. Burp them mid-feed and after every feed. If they don't burp after a minute or two, it's okay to stop patting.

## Diapers: What Goes In Must Come Out

You will become obsessed with poop. It's a rite of passage.

*   **Wet Diapers:** Expect at least one wet diaper for each day of life (1 on day one, 2 on day two) until day five.
*   **Dirty Diapers:** The first stool is *meconium*—black, tarry, and sticky. This is normal! As they eat more, it will transition to brown, then to mustard yellow (if breastfed) or tan (if formula fed).
*   **Umbilical Cord:** Keep it dry. Fold the diaper down so it doesn't rub against the stump.

## Sleep: The Art of the Nap

Newborns sleep 16-18 hours a day, but rarely for more than 2-3 hours at a time.

### Safe Sleep Basics
*   **Back to Sleep:** Always place baby on their back.
*   **Firm Surface:** Use a crib or bassinet with a tight-fitting sheet.
*   **Nothing Else:** No blankets, pillows, bumpers, or stuffed animals.
*   **Room Sharing:** The AAP recommends sharing a room (but not a bed) for at least the first 6 months to reduce SIDS risk.

### Swaddling
A swaddle mimics the womb and calms the startle reflex. Make sure it's snug around the chest but loose around the hips to prevent hip dysplasia.

## Postpartum Care for Mom

Do not forget about the patient who just gave birth. You!

### Vaginal Delivery Recovery
*   **Bleeding (Lochia):** It will be like a heavy period. Use the giant mesh underwear and pads. If you soak a maxi pad in an hour or pass clots larger than a golf ball, call your doctor.
*   **Pain Management:** Ice packs (padsicles) are your best friend. Stay on top of your ibuprofen/tylenol schedule if prescribed.

### C-Section Recovery
*   **Movement:** Walk slowly and gently to prevent blood clots, but do not lift anything heavier than the baby.
*   **Incision Care:** Keep it clean and dry. Watch for redness or oozing.

## Warning Signs: When to Call the Pediatrician

Don't use Dr. Google for medical emergencies. Call your doctor if:
*   **Fever:** Rectal temperature over 100.4°F (38°C). This is an emergency in a newborn.
*   **Feeding:** Baby refuses 2 feeds in a row.
*   **Vomiting:** Projectile vomiting (not just spit-up).
*   **Dehydration:** No wet diapers for 12 hours.
*   **Jaundice:** Skin or eyes look yellow (check in natural light).

## Emotional Check-In

Sometime in the first 24 hours, you will probably cry. You might look at your partner and say, *"What have we done?"* You might feel an overwhelming wave of love, or you might feel numb.

All of this is normal.

You are learning a new job with no training, while sleep-deprived and recovering from surgery or a major physical event. Be gentle with yourself. Take it one hour at a time. You are doing a great job.
