Welcome to parenthood! The first 24 hours at home with your newborn can feel like a blur of emotions, diapers, and very little sleep. But don't worry, you've got this.

## 1. Establish a Nest
Set up a comfortable spot in your living room where you can feed, rest, and watch your baby. Keep essentials nearby: water, snacks, burp cloths, and your phone charger.

## 2. Feeding Basics
Whether you are breastfeeding or formula feeding, the goal is simple: feed the baby when they are hungry.
- **Breastfeeding:** Aim for every 2-3 hours.
- **Formula:** Follow the pediatrician's volume guidelines.

## 3. Sleep (or lack thereof)
Newborns sleep a lot, but in short bursts. **Sleep when the baby sleeps** is a cliché for a reason—it's survival advice.

## 4. Ask for Help
If friends or family offer to help, say yes! Let them do the laundry, hold the baby while you shower, or bring you a meal.

You are doing a great job. breathe.
