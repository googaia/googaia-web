The books tell you babies cry to communicate. They cry when they are hungry, wet, or tired.
But what about when they cry for three hours straight, red-faced and screaming, and *nothing* you do helps?

Welcome to the hardest part of the fourth trimester. Whether you call it Colic, PURPLE Crying, or the Witching Hour, it is exhausting.

## What is Normal?
All babies cry. But specifically around 2 weeks of age, crying starts to increase. It peaks around 6-8 weeks and usually subsides by 3-4 months.

### The Rule of Threes (Colic)
Doctors traditionally diagnosed colic using the Rule of Threes:
*   Crying for more than **3 hours** a day.
*   For more than **3 days** a week.
*   For more than **3 weeks**.

However, we are moving away from the term "colic" (which implies a stomach issue) because for most babies, there is nothing medically wrong. It is developmental.

## PURPLE Crying
The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome uses the acronym **PURPLE** to describe this period. It helps parents understand that this is a *phase*, not a failure.

*   **P: Peak of Crying:** Crying increases each week, peaking at 2 months.
*   **U: Unexpected:** Crying can come and go without explanation.
*   **R: Resists Soothing:** Your usual tricks (feeding, rocking) might not stop it.
*   **P: Pain-like Face:** They look like they are in agony, even if they aren't.
*   **L: Long Lasting:** Can last 5 hours or more.
*   **E: Evening:** Leading to the term "Witching Hour."

## The Witching Hour Survival Guide
This usually hits between 5:00 PM and 10:00 PM. Here is how to cope.

### 1. The 5 S's (Dr. Harvey Karp)
Activate the "Calming Reflex."
1.  **Swaddle:** Tight, arms down.
2.  **Side/Stomach:** Hold them on their side (never sleep on stomach).
3.  **Shush:** Loud white noise (louder than the crying).
4.  **Swing:** Aggressive jiggling (support the head!). Not gentle rocking.
5.  **Suck:** Pacifier or finger.

### 2. Change the Sensory Input
*   **Go Outside:** Fresh air often resets a baby instantly.
*   **Water:** The sound of running water or a warm bath.
*   **Darkness:** Sometimes they are just overstimulated. Go into a pitch-black room.

### 3. Tag Team
If you are doing this with a partner, trade off every 30 minutes. Wearing noise-canceling headphones is NOT bad parenting if it helps you stay calm while holding a screaming baby.

## When to Call the Doctor
While PURPLE crying is normal, you want to rule out medical issues.
*   **Fever:** Any fever (100.4°F+) in a newborn needs ER attention.
*   **Vomiting:** not just spit-up, but projectile vomiting (Pyloric Stenosis).
*   **Stool Changes:** Blood or mucus in the diaper.
*   **Hair Tourniquet:** Check fingers, toes, and penis for a hair wrapped tightly around them.

## A Note on Shaken Baby Syndrome
This crying is the #1 trigger for Shaken Baby Syndrome.
If you feel like you are going to snap:
1.  Put the baby safely in the crib.
2.  Walk out of the room.
3.  Close the door.
4.  Go drink a glass of water, call a friend, or scream into a pillow for 10 minutes.
**The baby is safer crying alone in a crib than being held by a parent who has lost control.**

## Conclusion
This will end. You are not doing anything wrong. Your baby does not hate you. They are just having a hard time being a human. Hang in there.
