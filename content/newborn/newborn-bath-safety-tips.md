Bathing a newborn is one of those parenting tasks that looks adorable in commercials (bubbles! giggles!) but is actually terrifying in real life. They are slippery, they have no head control, and they usually scream the entire time.

But with the right prep, bath time can become a relaxing ritual for both of you.

## When to Start
*   **The First Bath:** Most hospitals now delay the first bath for at least 24 hours to preserve the vernix (the white waxy coating) which moisturizes the skin and regulates temperature.
*   **Umbilical Cord:** Until the stump falls off (1-2 weeks), stick to **Sponge Baths**. Submerging the stump can cause infection or delay healing.
*   **Circumcision:** If your son was circumcised, wait until the site heals (usually 1 week) before tub bathing.

## How Often?
Newborns don't play in the mud. They don't get dirty.
**1-3 times a week** is plenty. Bathing too often dries out their delicate skin. You should clean the "topp and tail" (face and diaper area) daily with a cloth, but a full bath isn't needed daily.

## Step 1: The Sponge Bath (Weeks 1-2)
Do this on a changing pad or a towel on the floor.
1.  **Gather Supplies:** Warm water bowl, washcloth, towel, fresh diaper.
2.  **Undress:** Only expose the part you are washing to keep them warm.
3.  **Face First:** Dip cloth in plain water (no soap). Wipe eyes from inner corner to outer corner.
4.  **Body:** Use a tiny drop of soap. Wash neck folds (milk hides there!), armpits, and chest.
5.  **Genitals Last:** Always wash "cleanest to dirtiest."

## Step 2: The Tub Bath (Weeks 2+)
Once the cord is off, you can move to a baby tub or the sink.

### Temperature Check
This is critical.
*   **Ideal Temp:** 100°F (37-38°C).
*   **Test:** Use a bath thermometer (the duck ones are great) or use your wrist/elbow. It should feel warm, not hot. Newborn skin burns in seconds.

### The Hold
*   Support the head and neck with your non-dominant arm. Grip their far shoulder/armpit securely.
*   Use your dominant hand to wash.
*   Never let go. If you forget the towel, you pick the baby up (wet and slippery) and take them with you. **Never leave a baby in water, even for a second.**

## Products: What You Need (and Don't)
*   **Soap:** Fragrance-free, tear-free. (Think: Cerave Baby, Aquaphor Baby). Avoid heavily scented products like traditional "baby lotion" which can irritate skin.
*   **Towels:** Hooded towels are cute, but regular towels work too.
*   **Lotion:** Apply while skin is still damp to lock in moisture.

## Cradle Cap (Seborrhea)
If you see yellow, crusty scales on the scalp, it's cradle cap. It's harmless.
*   *Fix:* Massage a little baby oil or olive oil onto the scalp *before* the bath to loosen scales. Use a soft brush (or clean toothbrush) to gently brush flakes away during the bath.

## Safety Red Flags
*   **Scalding:** adjust your water heater to max out at 120°F (49°C) to prevent accidental burns.
*   **Slips:** put a washcloth at the bottom of the baby tub to stop their bum from sliding around.
*   **Drowning:** Babies can drown in 1 inch of water. Silence your phone and leave it in the other room. Bath time is phone-free time.

## Conclusion
If your baby hates the bath, try getting in with them! Skin-to-skin in a warm bath can be very calming. Just be very careful getting in and out (have a partner hand you the baby). Eventually, splashing will be their favorite part of the day.
